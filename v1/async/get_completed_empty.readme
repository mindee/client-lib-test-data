SPECIAL INSTRUCTIONS FOR THE JSON FILE
======================================

In addition to testing the contents, the JSON file can be used to test HMAC validation.

Secret key for HMAC validation, from Mindee platform (fake one obviously):
ogNjY44MhvKPGTtVsI8zG82JqWQa68woYQH

Signature for HMAC validation, from `X-Mindee-Hmac-Signature` HTTP header:
5ed1673e34421217a5dbfcad905ee62261a3dd66c442f3edd19302072bbf70d0

If the file is modified in any way, the HMAC validation will fail.
